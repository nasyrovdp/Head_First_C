# Head_First_C

This repository contains various files (code, binaries, etc) for studies of the C programming language with the book "Head First C" (O'Reilly, D+D Griffiths).

This is the second attempt. This time I'll try to structure the files in a more convenient way.

The book refers to some files to be downloaded from their web-site. Unfortunately they're not available anymore. So I googled for some of them and I put the findings in the folder "additionalFiles".

All the files will be created on a Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu 20.04). Atom will be used as an editor, preinstalled gcc will be used for compilation.
